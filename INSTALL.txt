The installation of ppodd currently requires a working intel fortran installation on your machine. You can check by typing 

which ifort

if it is available.

The workflow for installation is

(1) pull the repository
    
    git clone git@213.171.204.22:decades-pp

(2) move into the folder

    cd decades-pp

(3) python setup.py clean --all

(4) python setup.py build

(5) sudo python setup.py install


Make sure that you execute command (4) as normal user and not as root. This is necessary, because many environment variables 
are needed to run the intel fortran compiler, which might not be set correctly for the root user.
