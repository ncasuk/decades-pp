Data processing issues that might need to be addressed
* Gin data not flagged as 3 when GIN_LAT and GIN_LON are 0

* averaging for creating 1Hz data is not working for angles (wind direction, gin hdg, etc.)
   import scipy.stats
   scipy.stats.circmean
  might be the solution

* adding gin offset constants to the flight constants

* adding the noturb code to the gin decades-pp

* From an email from Alan Blyth on the 5/7/13: 
  "When I try to run ncplot on the 4 July 1Hz data file, it 
   gives me an error message "File does not contain Time dimension".

   ncrename -d data_point,Time core_faam_20130704_v004_r0_b785_1Hz.nc out.nc

  fixes this problem.

* buck processing code and flagging; add it to the ppod code; translation from idl to python

* double check flagging to make sure that missing values do match the defintion of missing_values for all variables

* Below is a short bash script that can be run on the core netcdf file to make it compliant with some american 
  3d plotting software (I can't remember the name). But maybe it would be worthwhile to add the global
  coordinates to the netcdf file too 

#!/bin/bash

ofile=`echo $1 | sed s/.nc/_editted.nc/`

ncatted \
 -a 'conventions,global,m,c,NCAR-RAF/nimbus' \
 -a 'Version,global,c,c,1.3' \
 -a 'coordinates,global,c,c,LON_GPS LAT_GPS GPS_ALT Time' \
 -a '_FillValue,LAT_GPS,m,f,0' \
 -a '_FillValue,LON_GPS,m,f,0' \
 -o $ofile $1 
ncwa -a sps01 -O $ofile $ofile
ncrename -d data_point,Time -O $ofile
