separate backup and processing

File not in normal place .. do we copy it ?  Is that as simple as it could be...

Same idea for zip.. - or do we keep as zip for backup...

  Do I need to create new folders for DLU/RIO or use RAWDATA and RAWCORE


$RAWCORE/core_faam_YYYYMMDD_rX_bNNN_rawdlu.zip
$RAWDATA/bNNN_rawdlu/*

the rawdlu files should include the csv descriptors - or not...??






If just one file -

 is it a zip ?
    Unzip
 is it a folder ... what is in it ?
 
 
What could we have.

A single flight constants - 

  Do we look for data - where ?
  
A folder of cRIO data
  Do we look for flight constants ?
  
Would the flight constants ever be in with the data ??




Identify files...

    If folder - identify files within...
    
    If zip - identify files within...
    
Once all files identified

   reduce to minimum number
   


Identify

crio folder must contain .csv
