"""
Computations for converting raw SEA WCM-2000 power data into liquid water
content, ice water content, and total water content. Included are
functions for calculating dry air offsets, element efficiencies, and
housekeeping checks.

Calculation process is as follows;
- Calculate total element power
- Subtraction of dry power to obtain wet element power (1)
- Calculation of measured water content for each element (2)
- Simultaneous calculation of actual IWC and LWC from measured values (3)
- Addition of IWC and LWC to obtain TWC

Additional calculations;
(1) Determination of dry power from compensation element after calibration
(2) Determination of evaporative temperature, latent heat, and specific heats
(3) Various element efficiencies need to be calculated for this

Units:
Many of the parameters are obtained from empirical equations, thus the
use of the correct units is important. To use those equations and compare
values these functions use the units as used by SEA.

Water content:      g/m**3
Electrical power:   W (or J/s)
Temperature:        degrees celsius
True air speed:     m/s
Element dimensions: mm
Latent heat:        cal/g
